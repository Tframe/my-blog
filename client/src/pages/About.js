            <p>
                Welcome! We are the Frame family! Just your average everyday family figuring things out along the way.
                In 2010 Amy and I met in Sacramento, California through a mutual friend. We had a night full of
                good food and drinks, friends, dancing, and quite the adventure (we’ll just leave it at that). From there,
                the rest was history. Since then, we have graduated college, we’ve moved 4 times, bought two houses, and have
                had 2 baby boys. Least to say we’ve had a busy past few years ;). Now we are settling down and enjoying life to
                the fullest.

                We currently live in a cute Southern California town, Redlands. We love this town because of it’s small
                town charm, it’s proximity to everything (you can go surfing and snowboarding all in the same day!),
                and all the family we have nearby. Some things we love to do together are exploring new places, eating
                tasty foods, playing games, fixing up our older home, and raising our two beautiful boys, Finn and Owen.

                Hey! I’m Trevor. I’m husband to my beautiful wife, Amy, and now father to two of the most amazing boys,
                Finn and Owen. I first met Amy in Sacramento, California while studying economics (don’t ask me about the
                stock market, your guess is as good as mine) at Sacramento State. After graduating, I worked in banking for
                several years before I decided to go back to school to study Computer Science (and don’t ask me how to fix
                your computer either). While finishing up my second degree, I left my job to take care of Finn (no Owen yet).
                Since then (now is when Owen shows up), applying for entry level work without experience has been tough, so I
                decided to start this blog as a personal project. I figured it would be a project I could add to my resume while
                having memories saved for us to reminisce.

                Some other things I enjoy are playing games (video, board, outdoors, pretty much anything I can win at),
                cooking, building things, traveling, outdoor activities, parenting, and trying new things. Something my
                grandfather always told me that really stuck is to always try something at least once.
                So, feel free to message me something I should try!
